    "## Type aliases (`typedef`/`using`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A type alias is a different name by which a type can be identified. In C++, any valid type can be aliased so that it can be referred to with a different identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, there are two syntaxes for creating such type aliases: The first, inherited from the C language, uses the typedef keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "typedef existing_type new_type_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, a second syntax to define type aliases was introduced in the C++ language:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "using new_type_name = existing_type;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "typedef int integer;\n",
    "using character = char;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both aliases defined with typedef and aliases defined with using are semantically equivalent. The only difference is that typedef has certain limitations in the realm of templates that use has not. Therefore, using is more generic, although typedef has a longer history and is probably more common in existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that neither typedef nor using creates new distinct data types. They only create synonyms of existing types. That means that the type of myword above, declared with type WORD, can also be considered of type unsigned int; it does not matter, since both are referring to the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type aliases can be used to reduce the length of long or confusing type names, but they are most useful as tools to abstract programs from the underlying types they use. For example, by using an alias of `int` to refer to a particular kind of parameter instead of using `int` directly, it allows for the type to be easily replaced by long (or some other type) in a later version, without having to change every instance where it is used.\n"
