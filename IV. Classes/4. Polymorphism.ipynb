    "One of the key features of class inheritance is that a pointer to a derived class is type-compatible with a pointer to its base class. Polymorphism is the art of taking advantage of this simple but powerful and versatile feature.\n",

    "The example about the rectangle and triangle classes can be rewritten using pointers taking this feature into account. Function main declares two pointers to Polygon (named ppoly1 and ppoly2). These are assigned the addresses of rect and trgl, respectively, which are objects of type Rectangle and Triangle. Such assignments are valid, since both Rectangle and Triangle are classes derived from Polygon.\n"

    "## Virtual members\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual member is a member function that can be redefined in a derived class, while preserving its calling properties through references. The syntax for a function to become virtual is to precede its declaration with the `virtual` keyword.\n",

    "The member function area has been declared as `virtual` in the base class because it is later redefined in each of the derived classes. Non-virtual members can also be redefined in derived classes, but non-virtual members of derived classes cannot be accessed through a reference of the base class: i.e., if `virtual` is removed from the declaration of area in the example above, all three calls to area would return zero, because in all cases, the version of the base class would have been called instead.\n"

    "## Abstract base classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract base classes are something very similar to the Polygon class in the previous example. They are classes that can only be used as base classes and thus are allowed to have virtual member functions without definition (known as pure virtual functions). The syntax is to replace their definition by =0 (an equal sign and a zero):\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract base Polygon class could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "// abstract class CPolygon\n",
    "class Polygon {\n",
    "  protected:\n",
    "    int width, height;\n",
    "  public:\n",

    "      { width=a; height=b; }\n",
    "    virtual int area () =0;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that area has no definition; this has been replaced by =0, which makes it a pure virtual function. Classes that contain at least one pure virtual function are known as abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract base classes cannot be used to instantiate objects. Therefore, this last abstract base class version of Polygon could not be used to declare objects like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++ \n",
    "Polygon mypolygon;   // not working if Polygon is the abstract base class \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, an abstract base class is not useless. It can be used to create pointers to it and take advantage of all its polymorphic abilities. For example, the following pointer declarations would be valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "Polygon * ppoly1;\n",
    "Polygon * ppoly2;\n",
    "```\n",
