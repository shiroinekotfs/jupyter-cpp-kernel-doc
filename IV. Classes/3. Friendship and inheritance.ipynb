    "Classes in C++ can be extended, creating new classes which retain characteristics of the base class. This process, known as inheritance, involves a *base class* and a *derived class*: The *derived class* inherits the members of the base class, on top of which it can add its members.\n",

The public access specifier may be replaced by any one of the other access specifiers (protected or private). This access specifier limits the most accessible level for the members inherited from the base class: The members with a more accessible level are inherited with this level instead, while the members with an equal or more restrictive access level keep their restrictive level in the derived class.\n",
