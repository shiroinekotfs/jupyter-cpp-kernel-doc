    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are an expanded concept of data structures: like data structures, they can contain data members, but they can also contain functions as members.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instantiation of a class. In terms of variables, a class would be the type, and an object would be the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are defined using either keyword class or keyword struct, with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "class class_name {\n",
    "  access_specifier_1:\n",
    "    member1;\n",
    "  access_specifier_2:\n",
    "    member2;\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "} object_names;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `class_name` is a valid identifier for the class, `object_names` is an optional list of names for objects of this class. The body of the declaration can contain members, which can either be data or function declarations, and optionally access specifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes have the same format as plain data structures, except that they can also include functions and have these new things called access specifiers. An access specifier is one of the following three keywords: `private`, `public`, or `protected`. These specifiers modify the access rights for the members that follow them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `private` members of a class are accessible only from within other members of the same class (or from their \"friends\").\n",
    "* `protected` members are accessible from other members of the same class (or from their \"friends\"), but also from members of their derived classes.\n",
    "* `public` members are accessible from anywhere where the object is visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, all members of a class declared with the class keyword have private access for all its members. Therefore, any member that is declared before any other access specifier has private access automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, you will know how to use a class to do a calculation, where the main class that responsible for switching between the application mode (1: sum, 2: subtract), and its local functions that return that action.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you want to use the class directly, you may need to use `static` before declaring its datatype."

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, overloading constructors may declare *default constructor*. The default constructor is the constructor that takes no parameters, and it is special because it is called when an object is declared but is not initialized with any arguments. The default constructor sometimes comes up with *default values*."

    "\n",
    "The way of calling constructors by enclosing their arguments in parentheses, as shown above, is known as functional form. But constructors can also be called with other syntaxes:\n",

    "First, constructors with a single parameter can be called using the variable initialization syntax (an equal sign followed by the argument):\n",
