To do this, we use a destructor. A destructor is a member function very similar to a default constructor: it takes no arguments and returns nothing, not even void. It also uses the class name as its own name, but preceded with a tilde sign (~)\""

    "## Copy constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is passed a named object of its own type as argument, its copy constructor is invoked in order to construct a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A copy constructor is a constructor whose first parameter is of type reference to the class itself (possibly const qualified) and which can be invoked with a single argument of this type. For example, for a class MyClass, the copy constructor may have the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++ \n",
    "MyClass::MyClass (const MyClass&);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a class has no custom copy nor move constructors (or assignments) defined, an implicit copy constructor is provided. This copy constructor simply performs a copy of its own members. \n",
    "\n",
    "An implicit copy constructor is automatically defined. The definition assumed for this function performs a shallow copy, roughly equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "MyClass::MyClass(const MyClass& x) : a(x.a), b(x.b), c(x.c) {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This default copy constructor may suit the needs of many classes. But shallow copies only copy the members of the class themselves, and this is probably not what we expect for classes like class Example4 we defined above, because it contains pointers of which it handles its storage. For that class, performing a shallow copy means that the pointer value is copied, but not the content itself; This means that both objects (the copy and the original) would be sharing a single string object (they would both be pointing to the same object), and at some point (on destruction) both objects would try to delete the same block of memory, probably causing the program to crash on runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "The deep copy performed by this copy constructor allocates storage for a new string, which is initialized to contain a copy of the original object. In this way, both objects (copy and original) have distinct copies of the content stored in different locations.\n"

    "\n",
    "The copy assignment operator is an overload of operator= which takes a value or reference of the class itself as parameter. The return value is generally a reference to *this (although this is not required). For example, for a class MyClass, the copy assignment may have the following signature:\n",

    "MyClass& operator= (const MyClass&);\n",

    "## Move constructor and assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to copying, moving also uses the value of an object to set the value to another object. But, unlike copying, the content is actually transferred from one object (the source) to the other (the destination): the source loses that content, which is taken over by the destination. This moving only happens when the source of the value is an unnamed object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unnamed objects are objects that are temporary in nature, and thus haven't even been given a name. Typical examples of unnamed objects are return values of functions or type-casts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The move constructor and move assignment are members that take a parameter of type rvalue reference to the class itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "MyClass (MyClass&&);             // move-constructor\n",
    "MyClass& operator= (MyClass&&);  // move-assignment \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An rvalue reference is specified by following the type with two ampersands (&&). As a parameter, an rvalue reference matches arguments of temporaries of this type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of moving is most useful for objects that manage the storage they use, such as objects that allocate storage with new and delete. In such objects, copying and moving are really different operations:\n",
    "- Copying from A to B means that new memory is allocated to B and then the entire content of A is copied to this new memory allocated for B.\n",
    "- Moving from A to B means that the memory already allocated to A is transferred to B without allocating any new storage. It involves simply copying the pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilers already optimize many cases that formally require a move-construction call in what is known as Return Value Optimization. Most notably, when the value returned by a function is used to initialize an object. In these cases, the move constructor may actually never get called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even though rvalue references can be used for the type of any function parameter, it is seldom useful for uses other than the move constructor. Rvalue references are tricky, and unnecessary uses may be the source of errors quite difficult to track.\n"
