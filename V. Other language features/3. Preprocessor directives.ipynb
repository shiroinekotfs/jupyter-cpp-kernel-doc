    "Preprocessor directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#). These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor. The preprocessor examines the code before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated by regular statements.\n",

    "These preprocessor directives extend only across a single line of code. As soon as a newline character is found, the preprocessor directive is ends. No semicolon (;) is expected at the end of a preprocessor directive. The only way a preprocessor directive can extend through more than one line is by preceding the newline character at the end of the line by a backslash (\\).\n"

    "#define identifier replacement\n",

    "When the preprocessor encounters this directive, it replaces any occurrence of identifier in the rest of the code by replacement.

    "\n",
    "These directives allow to inclusion or discard of part of the code of a program if a certain condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#ifdef allows a section of a program to be compiled only if the macro that is specified as the parameter has been defined, no matter what its value is. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#ifdef TABLE_SIZE\n",
    "int table[TABLE_SIZE];\n",
    "#endif \n",
    "```\n",

    "In this case, the line of code `int table[TABLE_SIZE];` is only compiled if `TABLE_SIZE` was previously defined with `#define`, independently of its value. If it is not defined, that line will not be included in the program compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`#ifndef` serves the exact opposite: the code between `#ifndef` and `#endif` directives is only compiled if the specified identifier has not been previously defined. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#ifndef TABLE_SIZE\n",
    "#define TABLE_SIZE 100\n",
    "#endif\n",

    "\n",
    "The `#if`, `#else`, and `#elif` (i.e., \"else if\") directives serve to specify some condition to be met for the portion of code they surround to be compiled. The condition that follows `#if` or `#elif` can only evaluate constant expressions, including macro expressions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#if TABLE_SIZE>200\n",
    "#undef TABLE_SIZE\n",
    "#define TABLE_SIZE 200\n",

    "#elif TABLE_SIZE<50\n",
    "#undef TABLE_SIZE\n",
    "#define TABLE_SIZE 50\n",

    "#else\n",
    "#undef TABLE_SIZE\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the entire structure of `#if`, `#elif`, and `#else` chained directives ends with `#endif`.\n",
    "\n",
