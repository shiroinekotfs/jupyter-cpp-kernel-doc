    "## Open a file\n",
    "\n",
    "The first operation generally performed on an object of one of these classes is to associate it to a real file. This procedure is known as to open a file. An open file is represented within a program by a stream and any input or output operation performed on this stream object will be applied to the physical file associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file with a stream object we use its member function open:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "open (filename, mode);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where filename is a string representing the name of the file to be opened, and mode is an optional parameter with a combination of the following flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <table class=\"boxed\">\n",
    "<tbody><tr><td><code>ios::in</code></td><td>Open for input operations.</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td><code>ios::out</code></td><td>Open for output operations.</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td><code>ios::binary</code></td><td>Open in binary mode.</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td><code>ios::ate</code></td><td>Set the initial position at the end of the file.<br>\n",
    "If this flag is not set, the initial position is the beginning of the file.</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td><code>ios::app</code></td><td>All output operations are performed at the end of the file, appending the content to the current content of the file.</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td><code>ios::trunc</code></td><td>If the file is opened for output operations and it already exists, its previous content is deleted and replaced by the new one.</td></tr>\n",
    "</tbody></table>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "All these flags can be combined using the bitwise operator OR (|). For example, if we want to open the file example.bin in binary mode to add data we could do it by the following call to the member function open:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "ofstream myfile;\n",
    "myfile.open (\"example.bin\", ios::out | ios::app | ios::binary);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the open member functions of classes `ofstream`, `ifstream`, and `fstream` has a default mode that is used if the file is opened without a second argument:\n",

    "File streams opened in binary mode perform input and output operations independently of any format considerations. Non-binary files are known as text files, and some translations may occur due to the formatting of some special characters (like newline and carriage return characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first task that is performed on a file stream is generally to open a file, these three classes include a constructor that automatically calls the open member function and has the same parameters as this member. For example, we could also have declared the previous object and conducted the same opening operation in our previous example by writing:\n",
