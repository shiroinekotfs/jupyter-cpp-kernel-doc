    "# Name visibility\n",

    "Name visibility in C++ allows the program to either access some variables global or local, in certain ways. That helps both program and developer to indicate whether the variable is accessible, or not to create any further duplicate variable/function names."

    "## Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entities, such as variables, functions, and compound types need to be declared before being used in C++. The point in the program where this declaration happens influences its visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "An entity declared outside any block has ***global scope***, meaning that its name is valid anywhere in the code. An entity declared within a block, such as a function or a selective statement, has ***block scope*** and is only visible within the specific block in which it is declared, but not outside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables with block scope are known as ***local variables***. For example, a variable declared in the body of a function is a local variable that extends until the end of the function (i.e., until the brace } that closes the function definition), but not outside it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "int foo;        // global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "int some_function ()\n",
    "{\n",
    "  int bar;      // local variable\n",
    "  bar = 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int other_function ()\n",
    "{\n",
    "  foo = 1;  // ok: foo is a global variable\n",
    "  bar = 2;  // wrong: bar is not visible from this function\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In each scope, a name can only represent one entity. For example, there cannot be two variables with the same name in the same scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "int some_function ()\n",
    "{\n",
    "  int x;\n",
    "  x = 0;\n",
    "  double x;   // wrong: name already used in this scope\n",
    "  x = 0.0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The visibility of an entity with ***block scope*** extends until the end of the block, including inner blocks. Nevertheless, an inner block, because it is a different block, can re-utilize a name existing in an outer scope to refer to a different entity; in this case, the name will refer to a different entity only within the inner block, hiding the entity it names outside. While outside it, it will still refer to the original entity. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "int main () {\n",
    "  int x = 10;\n",
    "  int y = 20;\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    int x;   // ok, inner scope.\n",
    "    x = 50;  // sets value to inner x\n",
    "    y = 50;  // sets value to (outer) y\n",

    "  return 0;\n",

    "Note that y is not hidden in the inner block, and thus accessing y still accesses the outer variable.\n"

    "But non-local names bring more possibilities for name collision, especially considering that libraries may declare many functions, types, and variables, neither of them local, and some of them very generic.\n",
    "\n",

    ">\n",
    "> You can use `using namespace`, so you may no longer need a scope to access the resources inside the namespace.\n",
