\section{Introduction}
The Taylor series expansion represents a function as an infinite sum of terms involving its derivatives evaluated at a particular point. It is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \cdots
\end{equation}

where $f(x)$ is the function to be approximated, $a$ is the point around which the series is expanded, and $f^{(n)}(a)$ denotes the $n$th derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated at $a$.

\section{Example}
Let's consider the Taylor series expansion of the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ around $a = 0$. The derivatives of $\sin(x)$ at $x=0$ are:

\begin{align*}
f(0) &= \sin(0) = 0 \\
f'(0) &= \cos(0) = 1 \\
f''(0) &= -\sin(0) = 0 \\
f'''(0) &= -\cos(0) = -1 \\
& \text{and so on.}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the Taylor series expansion of $\sin(x)$ around $x=0$ is:

\begin{equation}
\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots
\end{equation}
